# Dependabot Auto-Merge Setup

The workflow `.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml` enables auto-merge
on Dependabot PRs. It authenticates with a Personal Access Token (PAT) stored
in the `DEPENDABOT_TOKEN` repository secret instead of the automatic
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, because events triggered by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not create new
workflow runs (a GitHub limitation to prevent infinite loops). If auto-merge
were authorized by `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the merge commit's push event would not
trigger downstream workflows (e.g., deployments on main).

## Creating the token

1. Go to **GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens >
   Tokens (classic)**.
2. Create a new token with these scopes:
   - **repo** — Full control of private repositories
   - **read:org** — Read org and team membership (required by `gh auth login`)
3. Store the token as a Dependabot secret:
   ```sh
   gh secret set DEPENDABOT_TOKEN --app dependabot
   ```
   Paste the token value when prompted.

The token should belong to a user with write access to the repository.
