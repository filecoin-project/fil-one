/**
 * POST /api/org/transfer — hand the Owner seat to another member.
 *
 * Owner-only (`org.transfer`), and the one org action behind a step-up: it is
 * the only verb that takes the caller's own authority away, so a session
 * somebody walked away from must not be enough to move the seat.
 * `requireMfaIfEnrolled` rather than `requireMfa`, because a user with nothing
 * enrolled would otherwise be denied outright rather than prompted — the gate
 * asks for a recent authentication, which everyone can produce.
 *
 * The target comes from the body rather than the path, so this is the one
 * member verb that cannot open with `requireManageableMember`; its own ceiling
 * is `authorize`'s, since only an Owner reaches here and an Owner reaches
 * everyone.
 *
 * The transaction opens with the org-deletion fence, which is what stops the
 * inverse items' deliberately unconditional updates from recreating memberships
 * a teardown has already walked past (`lib/membership-changes.ts`).
 *
 * The promotion and the demotion are one transaction, and the owner count moves
 * by nothing: the org has exactly one Owner before and after. The net-zero update
 * still writes, because touching the META row is what puts it in the
 * transaction — a promotion landing concurrently then conflicts instead of
 * interleaving with a swap that assumed the count.
 *
 * The outgoing Owner's pending Owner-invitations ride the same transaction, the
 * way a demotion's do: they are invitations the role they now hold could not
 * have issued.
 *
 * Nothing about billing changes. The subscription is keyed to the org and the
 * Stripe customer is untouched; ownership is a role attribute, not a payer.
