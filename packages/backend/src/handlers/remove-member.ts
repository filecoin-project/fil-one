 * demotion, the seat can also be handed over.
 */

/**
 * DELETE /api/org/members/{userId} — take a member out of the organization.
 *
 * Removal counts against the same ceiling as every other verb: an Admin reaches
 * Admin and below, and removing an Owner is `owners.manage`, exactly like
 * demoting one. Otherwise deletion would reach what demotion forbids.
 *
 * Self-removal goes through the same rules rather than around them, which has a
 * consequence worth stating: an Owner or Admin can remove themselves — and the
 * last Owner still cannot, because their own removal carries the guarded
 * decrement like anyone else's — while a Member or ReadOnly cannot, since
 * `members.manage` is what this route costs and their roles do not hold it.
 * "Leave this organization" for those two is a capability the matrix does not
 * grant in M1; it needs a product decision (a `members.leave` permission, or a
 * self-service carve-out) rather than a quiet exception here.
 *
 * One transaction: both membership rows, the `ownerCount` decrement when the
 * member was an Owner, the invitations the removal retires, and the event.
 *
 * Two families of invitation go, and the second is the one that makes removal
 * mean anything. The ones they ISSUED go because no role of theirs remains to
 * justify them. The ones ADDRESSED TO them go because the token in such a link
 * still works: a removed member who kept an old invitation redeems it and walks
 * straight back in at the role that link carries — a stale Owner invitation
 * turns demote-then-remove into a re-entry as Owner. Nothing else on the accept
 * path refuses it, since their address still matches and the inviter still holds
 * the authority they invited with.
 *
 * Finding those needs the member's address, which the membership row does not
 * carry — it is in the `USER#{userId}/PROFILE` row, written by the two paths
 * that learn a verified one, and that read is best-effort like every other
 * profile read here. A removal whose profile read fails or whose row predates
 * those writers still removes the member, sweeps what they issued, and logs that
 * the addressed-to sweep could not run.
 *
 * Removal is the narrowing to nothing: a key does not outlive the membership
 * that created it, so every attributed key the member minted is revoked at its
 * orchestrator before the membership rows go (`lib/commit-after-revoking-keys.ts`).
 * Rows with no recorded creator are outside the rule, as they are outside every
 * other, and FIL-1021's per-key review is confined to those.
