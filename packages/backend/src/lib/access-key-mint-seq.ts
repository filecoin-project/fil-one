/**
 * The member's access-key mint sequence: how many key rows have landed for them.
 *
 * It serializes two flows that otherwise share no item. A narrowing lists a
 * member's keys, revokes what the new role cannot hold, then writes the role; a
 * mint writes its key row under a condition on the creator's role. Neither side
 * can see the schedule where the row lands and the mint's own re-read completes
 * before the role write commits, so the narrowing would act on a listing that is
 * already stale. This row is the item they both touch: the mint bumps it, and
 * the narrowing asserts it has not moved since it listed.
 *
 * A sequence, not a count of live keys: only equality is ever asked of it, and
 * it outlives the membership: a member who left and rejoined must not be able to
 * satisfy a fence read before they went. Org teardown collects the row
 * (`lib/deletion-scrub.ts`).
