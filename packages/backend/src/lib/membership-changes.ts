/**
 * The writes that change who is in an organization and what they may do.
 *
 * Every one of them is a transaction item rather than a call, because none of
 * these changes is ever a single write: the canonical `MEMBER#` row and its
 * `MEMBERSHIP#` inverse item must agree about a role, the owner set has a counter
 * that has to move with it, and an audit event rides along
 * (`commitAudited`, `lib/audit.ts`). Handlers assemble the items, name the ones
 * whose conditions they care about, and hand the lot to one transaction.
 *
 * Three invariants live here rather than in the handlers:
 *
 * - **Canonical and inverse move together.** Both are written on create, delete,
 *   and every role change, so `MeResponse.memberships` can never show a role the
 *   member no longer holds.
 * - **The last Owner cannot leave.** `ownerCount` on `ORG#{orgId}/META` carries
 *   the delta, and the guard is that same update's condition — DynamoDB permits
 *   one operation per item per transaction, so the check and the decrement have
 *   to be the same operation.
 * - **An invitation does not outlive its issuer's authority.** The accept
 *   transaction carries a `ConditionCheck` on the inviter's membership row,
 *   expressed in the roles the registry says may invite the role in question.

 * an inverse item the scrub has already walked past — a membership in a torn-down
 * org, showing in `/me` and counted by the deletion census, that nothing revisits.
 * Conditioning the inverse on the canonical row is not open to us: DynamoDB
 * permits one operation per item per transaction, and the canonical row already
 * holds the Update. The fence is a different item and refuses the whole
