/**
 * Revoke the keys a membership change strands, then commit the change.
 *
 * The order is the whole of it. An access key carries its own permission set,
 * fixed when it was minted, and nothing at Aurora or FTH evaluates it against
 * the role its holder now has. So the keys the member could no longer mint are
 * revoked at the vendor BEFORE the membership is written: a member is never
 * wider at a storage vendor than the role the console records for them.
 *
 * The pass reads a list, and a key minted after that reading is not on it. Both
 * ends of that window belong to the mint rather than here: its key row carries
 * a `ConditionCheck` on the creator's role, and it reads the role once more
 * after the row lands (`create-access-key.ts`). A key that outlives this pass
 * is discarded by the request that created it.
 *
 * A change that revokes no key touches no vendor, so it stays one transaction
 * and one event, the form every membership change took in M1. One that does
 * opens a two-phase pair around the pass, and the completion rides the
 * membership items with the revoked ids on it, so the change and its record
 * stay atomic. Ids rather than a count, because each revocation is its own
 * `key.deleted` outside this transaction and the ids are what join them.
 *
 * The three ways it can fail are the caller's to answer, because none is
 * expressible as data here: which item cancelled means something different to
 * each change, and reading it may take another lookup. Whatever the answer, the
 * keys already revoked are gone and the member's clients are already broken, so
 * the member is told before the caller is answered and the response names them.
 * The retry is the same request, which finds fewer keys: every completed
 * revocation deleted its row.
