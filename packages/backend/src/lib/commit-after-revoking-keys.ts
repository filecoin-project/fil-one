/**
 * Revoke the keys a membership change strands, then commit the change.
 *
 * The order is the whole of it. An access key carries its own permission set,
 * fixed when it was minted, and nothing at Aurora or FTH evaluates it against
 * the role its holder now has. So the keys the member could no longer mint are
 * revoked at the vendor BEFORE the membership is written: a member is never
 * wider at a storage vendor than the role the console records for them.
 *
 * The pass reads a list, and a key minted after that reading is not on it. A
 * mint under a role that has already narrowed is discarded by the request that
 * created it (`create-access-key.ts`); the reverse ordering is refused by the
 * fence appended here, which turns the change into a retry whose listing
 * includes the key (`lib/access-key-mint-seq.ts`).
 *
 * A change that revokes no key stays one transaction and one event. One that
 * does opens a two-phase pair around the pass, and the completion rides the
 * membership items carrying the revoked ids, so the change and its record stay
 * atomic — ids rather than a count, because each revocation is its own
 * `key.deleted` and the ids are what join them.
 *
 * Which item cancelled means something different to each change, so the answer
 * is the caller's. Whichever it gives, the revoked keys are gone and the
 * member's clients are already broken, so the member is told first and the
 * response names them.
