/**
 * Organization membership, in OrgTable.
 *
 * Four row shapes, all pk/sk (the table has no GSIs, like every other table
 * here), plus one key reserved for SSO:
 * - `ORG#{orgId}` / `MEMBER#{userId}` — the authoritative membership: role,
 *   when and how the member joined.
 * - `USER#{userId}` / `MEMBERSHIP#{orgId}` — the inverse item that answers
 *   "which orgs does this user belong to" without an index, the same idiom as
 *   `RAGKEYHASH#…/LOOKUP`. Written in the same transaction as the canonical
 *   row on create, delete, and every role change, so the two can never
 *   disagree about a role.
 * - `ORG#{orgId}` / `META` — org-level counters owned by this module, starting
 *   with `ownerCount`, the last-Owner invariant. It sits beside the rows it
 *   counts so every owner-set transaction is single-table.
 * - `ORG#{orgId}` / `ACCESSKEY_MINT_SEQ#{userId}` — how many access-key rows have
 *   landed for the member, which a role narrowing asserts is unchanged since it
 *   listed their keys (`lib/access-key-mint-seq.ts`).
 *
 * Two more shapes belong to invitations, and their key builders are here beside
 * the membership ones because an accept transaction writes both families at
 * once:
 * - `ORG#{orgId}` / `INVITE#{inviteId}` — the canonical invitation.
 * - `INVITETOKEN#{sha256(token)}` / `LOOKUP` — the inverse item that resolves an
 *   accept link, written and deleted in the same transaction as the row it
 *   points at. Only the hash is ever stored; the token itself exists in the
 *   email and nowhere else. The lifecycle lives in `lib/invitations.ts`.
 * - `ORG#{orgId}` / `INVITEADDR#{emailNorm}` — the one item every invitation to
 *   an address writes, so two of them cannot both land. It names the invitation
 *   that currently holds the address and nothing else.
 *
 * The org profile row stays in UserInfoTable (`ORG#{orgId}/PROFILE`), so the
 * transactions that change an org's name and its membership span both tables.
