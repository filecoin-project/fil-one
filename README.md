## AWS account

|                     |                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Staging/dev Account | `654654381893`                         |
| Region              | `us-east-2`                            |
| SSO portal          | https://d-9067ff87d6.awsapps.com/start |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 24
- **AWS CLI** — required for S3 sync and CloudFront invalidation during deploy. [Install guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

## Setup

**1. Configure the AWS profile (one-time)**

```bash
aws configure sso --profile filone
```

When prompted:

- SSO Session name: `filone-sandbox`
- SSO start URL: `https://d-9067ff87d6.awsapps.com/start`
- SSO region: `us-east-1`
- SSO registration scopes: `sso:account:access`
- Account ID: `654654381893`
- Role: `AdministratorAccess`
- Default region: `us-east-2` - Or whatever region you want.
- Output format: `json`

**2. Log in and activate the profile**

_MUST do this before you can deploy._

```bash
aws sso login --profile filone
```

Then set the profile for your shell session so SST picks it up:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=filone
```

To make this permanent, add it to your shell config:

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export AWS_PROFILE=filone' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

You can verify it's working with:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

**4. Set SST secrets (one-time per stage)**

```bash
pnpx sst secret set Auth0ClientId <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set Auth0ClientSecret <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set Auth0MgmtClientId <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set Auth0MgmtClientSecret <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set Auth0MgmtRuntimeClientId <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set Auth0MgmtRuntimeClientSecret <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set StripeSecretKey <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set StripePriceId <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set AuroraBackofficeToken <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set SendGridApiKey <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set HubSpotServiceKey <value> [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set GrafanaLokiAuth '<instanceId>:<apiKey>' [--stage <stage>]
pnpx sst secret set DeletionCodeHmacKey <value> [--stage <stage>]
```

Omit `--stage` to set for your personal dev stage (defaults to OS username).

There are two Auth0 M2M credentials with different scopes — see [`docs/Auth0OneTimeSetup.md`](./docs/Auth0OneTimeSetup.md). The `AuroraBackofficeToken` is from the Aurora Back Office dashboard — see the [API token](#api-token) section below. The `GrafanaLokiAuth` secret is from Grafana Cloud — see the [Observability](#observability) section below.

`DeletionCodeHmacKey` is the only entry with no dashboard to copy from — it is our own key, not a vendor credential, so generate it with `openssl rand -hex 32`. It keys the account-deletion code HMAC, and rotating it invalidates every code already issued on that stage. It has no default and is linked on every stage, so `sst deploy` fails without it; `staging` and `production` therefore need it set before any branch that links it reaches main, since both deploy automatically from there. CI preview stages generate their own.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev              # SST live dev mode (live Lambda debugging)
pnpm run build            # Build all packages
pnpm run deploy:dev       # Build and deploy personal dev stack (uses OS username as stage)
pnpm run remove           # Remove your personal dev stack
pnpm run storybook        # Start Storybook dev server on port 6006
pnpm run test:storybook   # Run Storybook tests (browser-based, requires Playwright)
pnpm run lint             # Lint and typecheck TypeScript code (via oxlint)
pnpm run lint:fix         # Lint and auto-fix where possible
```

> **Do not run `deploy:staging` or `deploy:production` manually.** Staging and production deployments should go through CI/CD.

```bash
# Local website dev server (for frontend-only changes)
cd packages/website && pnpm run dev
```

### E2E Tests

Playwright end-to-end test suite under `tests/e2e/` that runs against a deployed environment (typically staging). The `@playwright/test` package is already a devDependency, so `pnpm install` covers it.

**Install browser binaries** (one-time):

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
```

#### Required env vars

| Variable                                                          | Purpose                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `BASE_URL`                                                        | The deployed app URL (e.g. `https://staging.fil.one`) |
| `E2E_PAID_EMAIL` / `E2E_PAID_PASSWORD` / `E2E_PAID_USER_ID`       | Paid test user (`_USER_ID` is the FilOne user id)     |
| `E2E_UNPAID_EMAIL` / `E2E_UNPAID_PASSWORD` / `E2E_UNPAID_USER_ID` | Unpaid test user                                      |
| `E2E_TRIAL_EMAIL` / `E2E_TRIAL_PASSWORD` / `E2E_TRIAL_USER_ID`    | Trial test user                                       |

In CI, all nine credential vars come from GitHub repository secrets (see [.github/workflows/e2e-staging.yaml](.github/workflows/e2e-staging.yaml) and [.github/workflows/test-staging.yaml](.github/workflows/test-staging.yaml)). Both workflows also configure AWS via OIDC (using `vars.AWS_ROLE_ARN`) so the billing-state reset can write to the staging `BillingTable`.

#### Seeded buckets per region

The bucket/upload tests in `tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.spec.ts` run once per S3 region (`eu-west-1` and `us-east-1`, see `tests/e2e/destructive/regions.util.ts`) and reuse existing buckets rather than creating them (the account-wide bucket limit is 100 and buckets are not yet deletable). Each test account — paid, unpaid, and trial — must therefore have at least one bucket in **each** region on the target stage; otherwise the test fails with a `No <region> bucket found` error.

Seeding is automatic for all three accounts: the `seed-buckets` Playwright project ([tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.setup.ts](tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.setup.ts)) runs after `setup` and calls `ensureBucketInEachRegion` ([tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.util.ts](tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.util.ts)), which creates a bucket only for regions where the account has none. This keeps the suite working when a stage resets its storage layer and all buckets disappear; creation stays conditional so repeated runs do not leak buckets toward the 100-bucket limit.

The **unpaid** account is `past_due`, and the subscription guard rejects write requests in that state with 403 `GRACE_PERIOD_WRITE_BLOCKED`. For that role the seeding step flips `subscriptionStatus` to `active` in the `BillingTable` (`activateSubscription` in [tests/e2e/destructive/billing-reset.util.ts](tests/e2e/destructive/billing-reset.util.ts)), creates the missing buckets, then restores `past_due` in a `finally` block — before any spec runs, so the dashboard and upload tests still see the write-blocked state.

If the bucket list itself fails (`GET /api/buckets` returning a 5xx, e.g. when a stage's per-tenant S3 credentials in SSM have gone stale), the seeding step fails loudly with the status and response body rather than mistaking the error for an empty account — and because the browser projects depend on it, the whole run stops.

The upload tests report backend failures the same way. An upload is two round-trips — `POST /api/presign`, then a `PUT` straight to the region's S3 endpoint (`getS3Endpoint` in [packages/shared/src/constants.ts](packages/shared/src/constants.ts)) — and neither failure navigates anywhere, so `submitUploadExpectingSuccess` reads both responses and fails with the region, status and response body. Without it, a region whose storage backend returns a 502 is indistinguishable from a hung browser: both surface only as a `toHaveURL` timeout on the navigation back to the bucket page. A rejected `PUT` has taken ~30s to come back, so these tests get a longer timeout than the default.

#### Running locally

The `test:e2e` script wraps Playwright in `sst shell` so SST Resource bindings (e.g. `BillingTable` name) resolve to the current SST stage. Deploy a stage first, then:

```bash
SST_STAGE=staging \
BASE_URL=https://staging.fil.one \
E2E_PAID_EMAIL=...   E2E_PAID_PASSWORD=...   E2E_PAID_USER_ID=<uuid> \
E2E_UNPAID_EMAIL=... E2E_UNPAID_PASSWORD=... E2E_UNPAID_USER_ID=<uuid> \
E2E_TRIAL_EMAIL=...  E2E_TRIAL_PASSWORD=...  E2E_TRIAL_USER_ID=<uuid> \
pnpm test:e2e --project=chromium
```

Your local AWS credentials (e.g. via `aws sso login`) must have write access to the staging stage's `BillingTable`.

After a run, an HTML report is generated at `playwright-report/`. To view it:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

> CI runs these tests automatically against preview deployments on PRs.

#### Subscription state reset

[tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts](tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts) re-seeds the `BillingTable` row for each role before logging that role in. This is necessary because trial periods can elapse and `past_due` subscriptions can advance to `canceled` between scheduled runs, so prior runs' state is not safe to reuse.

The seed values come from [tests/e2e/billing-reset.ts](tests/e2e/billing-reset.ts):

- **paid** → `active`, `currentPeriodEnd` = now + 30d
- **unpaid** → `past_due`, `lastPaymentFailedAt` = yesterday
- **trial** → `trialing`, `trialEndsAt` = now + 14d

The reset writes directly to DynamoDB (mirrors the integration-test pattern in [tests/integration/helpers.ts](tests/integration/helpers.ts)). It does **not** sync with Stripe — the local DB is the source of truth for `subscriptionStatus`, and Stripe state is allowed to drift for these test users.

#### How auth works

Each role logs in once via [tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts](tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts) and the session cookies are persisted to `.auth/<role>.json`. Authenticated specs reuse that storage state instead of going through the Auth0 login UI on every test.

The `.auth/` directory is gitignored — the JSON files are regenerated on every run and **must not be committed**.

#### Adding a new role

1. Add an entry to [tests/e2e/roles.ts](tests/e2e/roles.ts) `STORAGE_STATE`.
2. Add the role's desired subscription state to `DESIRED_STATE` in [tests/e2e/billing-reset.ts](tests/e2e/billing-reset.ts).
3. Add the role to the `roles` array in [tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts](tests/e2e/auth.setup.ts) (with `email`, `password`, `userId`).
4. Add `E2E_<ROLE>_EMAIL`, `E2E_<ROLE>_PASSWORD`, `E2E_<ROLE>_USER_ID` to `REQUIRED_CREDENTIAL_VARS` in [playwright.config.ts](playwright.config.ts).
5. Add the same three vars to the `env:` block in both [.github/workflows/e2e-staging.yaml](.github/workflows/e2e-staging.yaml) and [.github/workflows/test-staging.yaml](.github/workflows/test-staging.yaml), and provision the corresponding GitHub secrets.
6. If the role needs a seeded bucket per region, add it to `SEED_PLAN` in [tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.setup.ts](tests/e2e/destructive/buckets.setup.ts), with `needsActiveSubscription: true` when its desired subscription state blocks writes.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests, located in tests/integration/, confirm that individual modules or services interact correctly with one another — for instance, ensuring Stripe webhook handlers produce the expected state transitions in DynamoDB — by running against real AWS and Stripe resources.

While E2E tests (Playwright) cover full, business-critical user journeys spanning the entire system, integration tests focus more narrowly on backend logic at specific integration points.

**Run tests** (requires deployed SST stage):

```bash
pnpm test:integration
```

Tests run inside `sst shell` so that SST resource bindings (table names, Stripe keys, etc.) are available as environment variables.

### Personal Dev Stack

```bash
pnpm deploy:dev
```

Uses your OS username as the stage name. Serves the app at `https://{username}.dev.fil.one` (the SST stack creates the Route 53 record in the delegated `dev.fil.one` zone — see [`docs/architectural-decisions/2026-05-dev-subdomain.md`](docs/architectural-decisions/2026-05-dev-subdomain.md)). Stage names must be valid DNS labels: lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`; 1–63 chars; no leading or trailing hyphen.

If you are having trouble deploying after SST changes (e.g., a version bump of SST or drift on components from manual actions), you may need to refresh the stack:

```bash
pnpm run refresh
pnpm deploy:dev
```

### Staging / Production

> **Do not deploy to staging or production manually** unless there is a very good reason. Use CI/CD.

For reference, the CI/CD pipeline runs:

```bash
pnpm run deploy:staging
pnpm run deploy:production
```

Custom domains require a pre-provisioned ACM certificate in us-east-1 and a DNS CNAME pointing to the CloudFront distribution (managed by a separate pipeline).

Infrastructure-only deploys are available for cases where only the base infra (OIDC, IAM roles) needs updating:

```bash
pnpm run deploy:infra:staging
pnpm run deploy:infra:production
```

### Live Dev Mode

```bash
pnpx sst dev
```

Runs Lambda functions locally with live reload. Changes to handler code take effect immediately without redeploying.

### Troubleshooting: CloudFormation Stack Stuck in Rollback

The deploy-time setup Lambda (`setup-integrations`) runs as a CloudFormation custom resource. If it fails (e.g., missing Auth0 scopes, API errors), the CloudFormation stack enters `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED` state and blocks all future deploys.

**To unblock:**

1. Force the rollback to complete, skipping the failed resource:

```bash
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --resources-to-skip Setup
```

The stack name is in the error output (e.g., `SetupStack-efd549a`).

2. Wait for the stack to reach `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
```

3. Fix the underlying issue (grant missing scopes, etc.), then redeploy.

For MFA-specific troubleshooting, see [`docs/architectural-decisions/2026-03-mfa-enrollment.md`](docs/architectural-decisions/2026-03-mfa-enrollment.md#troubleshooting).

## ACM Certificate Provisioning & DNS Setup

Custom domains require an ACM certificate in **us-east-1** (CloudFront requirement). Managed in [`fil-one/infrastructure`](https://github.com/fil-one/infrastructure) via HCP Terraform.

- **`app.fil.one` / `staging.fil.one`** — one ACM cert per domain, DNS-validated through Cloudflare.
- **`*.dev.fil.one`** — single wildcard cert shared by every ephemeral stage (PR previews and personal dev stacks). `dev.fil.one` is delegated from Cloudflare to a Route 53 hosted zone in the staging AWS account, so SST creates per-stage A/AAAA records without needing a Cloudflare API token. See [`docs/architectural-decisions/2026-05-dev-subdomain.md`](docs/architectural-decisions/2026-05-dev-subdomain.md).

## Auth0

Auth0 powers authentication: Universal Login, two M2M applications per tenant (deploy-time and runtime), MFA, and passkeys as primary authentication. Most of this is automated by the deploy-time setup Lambda — but a handful of dashboard toggles must be configured manually once per tenant before the first deploy.

The full operator runbook (tenant settings, application settings, MFA, passkeys, and both M2M apps) is in [`docs/Auth0OneTimeSetup.md`](./docs/Auth0OneTimeSetup.md). For the design rationale, see the ADRs under `docs/architectural-decisions/`:

- `2026-03-mfa-enrollment.md` — MFA factor selection + Post-Login Action
- `2026-05-passkey-primary-authentication.md` — passkeys as primary authentication

Auth0 credentials are managed as SST secrets (`Auth0ClientId`, `Auth0ClientSecret`). See the "Set SST secrets" step above.

**Callback and logout URLs are configured automatically during deploy** — no manual Dashboard edits needed. The deploy-time setup Lambda adds the correct URLs for the deployed domain.

**Application settings** (Applications > your app > Settings):

- Under **Advanced Settings > Grant Types**, ensure **Authorization Code** and **Refresh Token** are enabled.

**API setup** (APIs > Create API):

- **Identifier (audience)**: `app.fil.one` (prod) — this must match `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` in `sst.config.ts`. It's what makes Auth0 issue a JWT access token (instead of an opaque one) and is the `aud` claim the middleware validates.
- Under the API's **Machine to Machine Applications** tab, authorize your application so it can exchange tokens.

### Auth0 MFA Setup

MFA is opt-in per user (database and social connections). Auth0 handles enrollment and challenge via Universal Login. See `docs/architectural-decisions/2026-03-mfa-enrollment.md` for the full architectural decision record.

Two separate M2M applications are used to limit the scope of credentials exposed to Lambda functions.

#### Deploy automation (`Auth0MgmtClientId` / `Auth0MgmtClientSecret`)

Used only by the deploy-time setup Lambda to configure Auth0 on each deploy. Not available to runtime Lambda functions.

**1. Enable MFA factors** (Security > Multi-factor Auth) — manual, one-time per tenant:

- Enable **One-time Password** (authenticator apps)
- Enable **WebAuthn with FIDO Security Keys** (passkeys/security keys)
- Enable **WebAuthn with FIDO Device Biometrics** (fingerprint, Face ID)
- Do **not** enable **Email** or **SMS** — turning Email on tenant-wide causes Auth0 to auto-enroll every verified-email user into email MFA, defeating the strong-factor-only design
- Set policy to **"Never"** (MFA is controlled entirely by the Post-Login Action)
- Under additional settings, enable **"Customize MFA Factors using Actions"**

**2. Post-Login Action** — automated on deploy:

The deploy-time setup Lambda (`setup-integrations`) automatically creates, deploys, and binds an `MFA Enrollment Trigger` Action to the Login flow (staging/production only). This Action checks `app_metadata.mfa_enrolling` on each login — when `true`, it triggers MFA enrollment via Universal Login and clears the flag after success. No manual Action setup is needed.

### Auth0 Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Applications

Two separate M2M applications per tenant limit the blast radius of credentials. The deploy-time app is only available to the setup Lambda; the runtime app is available to request-time handlers.

#### Deploy automation (`Auth0MgmtClientId` / `Auth0MgmtClientSecret`)

Used only by the deploy-time setup Lambda to configure Auth0 on each deploy.

#### Runtime user management (`Auth0MgmtRuntimeClientId` / `Auth0MgmtRuntimeClientSecret`)

Used by request-time Lambda handlers (`update-profile`, `resend-verification`, `enroll-mfa`, `disable-mfa`, `delete-mfa-enrollment`, `get-me`) to manage user records, trigger verification emails, and manage MFA enrollments.

## Stripe (Billing)

### 1. Create the product in Stripe Dashboard

Use **test mode** first. Switch to live mode for production.

1. **Products > Add product**
   - Name: `Fil.one Storage`
   - Description: `Decentralized cloud storage — $4.99/TB/month, $4.99/month minimum`
2. **Add price** on that product:
   - Pricing model: **Graduated tiering**
   - Recurring: Monthly
   - Usage type: **Metered** (sum of usage values during period), unit label: `GB`
   - First tier: up to `1000` GB, flat fee `$4.99` — this flat fee is the monthly minimum
   - Final tier: `$0.00499` per GB — the same $4.99/TB rate, for usage above the first tier
3. Note the **Price ID** (`price_xxxxx`)

Usage is metered in decimal GB (`GB_BYTES = 1e9`, see the usage-reporting worker),
so 1000 GB of included usage is exactly the $4.99 the flat fee covers.

The first tier's flat amount is what the console shows as the monthly minimum:
`GET /api/billing` reports it as `subscription.monthlyMinimumCents`, read from the
price the org's subscription is actually billed on. Customers grandfathered on the
older plain per-unit price have no tiers and therefore no minimum. The price
snapshot is cached on the billing record so the minimum stays correct while the
Stripe API is unavailable.

The endpoint never guesses the minimum: it fails the request instead of reporting
"no minimum" when the price is graduated but carries no tiers, or when Stripe's
exact decimal amount cannot be parsed.

`GET /api/billing` is a read model that grants nothing: it reports the stored
`subscriptionStatus` verbatim and never synthesizes entitlement. An account with
no billing record — or a record without a status (e.g. the customer mapping
`create-setup-intent` writes) — is reported as
`{subscription: {planId: 'none', status: 'inactive'}}`, the same answer the subscription guard
enforces with its 403 `SUBSCRIPTION_INACTIVE`. See
[the ADR](docs/architectural-decisions/2026-07-billing-read-model-never-synthesizes-entitlement.md).

### 2. Configure Customer Portal

**Settings > Billing > Customer portal** — enable:

- Update payment method
- View billing history / invoices
- Cancel subscription

### 3. Webhooks (automated)

**Webhook endpoints are created and managed automatically during deploy.** The deploy-time setup Lambda creates the Stripe webhook endpoint with the correct URL for the deployed domain and stores the signing secret in AWS SSM Parameter Store. No manual configuration needed.

Events registered: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`

Run this command to delete all webhooks created by PR preview deployments (including hooks from active pull requests):

```bash
stripe webhook_endpoints list --limit 100 | \
  jq -r '.data[] | select(.metadata.stage // "" | startswith("pr-")) | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} stripe webhook_endpoints delete {} --confirm
```

### 4. Secrets

Stripe credentials are managed as SST secrets (`StripeSecretKey`, `StripePriceId`, `StripePublishableKey`). See the "Set SST secrets" step above.

## SendGrid (Transactional Email)

Auth0 transactional emails (verification, password reset, etc.) are sent via SendGrid. The deploy-time setup Lambda configures Auth0 to use SendGrid automatically.

API keys are managed at: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys

The `SendGridApiKey` SST secret should be a key with **Mail Send** permission only. See the "Set SST secrets" step above.

## Aurora API Clients

The project includes generated TypeScript clients for the Aurora APIs, built
with [Hey API](https://heyapi.dev/):

- **Back Office API** — `packages/aurora-backoffice-client/` (tenant management, admin operations)
- **Portal API** — `packages/aurora-portal-client/` (access keys, buckets, tenant-facing operations)

### API Token

The backend uses an API token to authenticate with the Aurora Back Office API
(e.g., to create tenants on user registration).

**Generating the token:**

1. Log in to the Aurora Back Office dashboard at
   https://backoffice.dev.aur.lu/ff/docs/backoffice-api
2. Navigate to the API token management section
3. Generate a new token with the required permissions

**Setting the SST secret:**

```bash
pnpx sst secret set AuroraBackofficeToken <token> [--stage <stage>]
```

### Regenerating the clients

After API changes, update the relevant Swagger spec and regenerate:

**Back Office client:**

1. Download the updated Swagger spec from
   https://backoffice.dev.aur.lu/api/v1/docs/swagger.json (open the page, then
   save the JSON loaded by the page)
2. Replace `packages/aurora-backoffice-client/aurora-backoffice.swagger.json`
   with the downloaded file

**Portal client:**

Download the updated Swagger spec from the Aurora Portal API docs and save it to `packages/aurora-portal-client/aurora-portal.swagger.json`:

```bash
curl https://docs.aur.lu/portal-api-spec.json -o packages/aurora-portal-client/aurora-portal.swagger.json && oxfmt
```

Reformat the file:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

**Regenerate both clients:**

```bash
pnpm generate:api-clients
```

## UI components (`packages/website/src/components/`)

UI components live directly in the website package under `packages/website/src/components/`. There is no separate design-system package or git submodule.

The visual design draws on `@filecoin-foundation/ui-filecoin` as the original inspiration, but all components have been adapted for this Vite/React app and are maintained in-tree.

## Observability

Telemetry is sent to Grafana Cloud. See `docs/architectural-decisions/2026-03-observability-architecture.md` for details.

**Logs**: CloudWatch Logs → Kinesis Firehose → Grafana Cloud Loki (per-stage, managed by the main stack).
**Metrics**: CloudWatch Metrics → Metric Stream → Kinesis Firehose → Grafana Cloud Prometheus (per-account, managed by the `infra/` stack — one stream captures all Lambda metrics in the account regardless of stage). Developer stacks do not stream metrics to Grafana; use the CloudWatch console instead.

### Grafana secrets

Generate API keys in Grafana Cloud (grafana.com → your stack → Connections → API keys):

- **GrafanaLokiAuth** (main stack): Plain `<instanceId>:<apiKey>` where instanceId is your Loki instance ID (sent as-is in the Firehose `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key` header)
- **GrafanaPrometheusAuth** (infra stack): Plain `<instanceId>:<apiKey>` where instanceId is your Prometheus instance ID

```bash
# Main stack secrets
pnpx sst secret set GrafanaLokiAuth '<instanceId>:<apiKey>' [--stage <stage>]

# Infra stack secrets (run from infra/ directory)
cd infra && pnpx sst secret set GrafanaPrometheusAuth '<instanceId>:<apiKey>' --stage <stage>
```
